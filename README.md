InControl-VirtualDeviceController
=================================

This is the source to the official Virtual Device Controller used by InControl Home Automation (www.incontrolha.com)

This solution was created using Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. To create your own Controller, download this source and use it as a template. Once you have compiled your DLL, close InControl and copy the DLL to your /plugins folder and then restart InControl.
